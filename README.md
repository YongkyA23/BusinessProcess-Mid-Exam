Mini Case 2: Expenditure Cycle Case Study: Indo Medika Purchasing and Receiving Process (40%)
Indo Medika is a medical supplies company that sells its products to hospitals, clinics, and doctor’s offices. Indo Medika uses an ERP system for all its business processes. The inventories are maintained on a real-time basis in an inventory database in an enterprise system. The inventory records include reorder points for all regularly used items and one or two preferred suppliers for each item. Suppliers are researched and approved by the purchasing manager before being added to the supplier database by a clerk designated to maintain the database.
Indo Medika employs the following procedures for purchasing and receiving:
Throughout the day, the supplies clerk receives an online report listing, displaying those items that have reached their reorder point* from the computer system. The clerk reviews the report and creates a purchase requisition by filling out a requisition form in the company’s enterprise system. Each requisition has a unique identifier, and after creation, the purchase requisition data and inventory master data are updated to reflect the purchase requisition. Inventory manager approval is required for purchases over $1,000 and not covered by a blanket order.
The inventory manager can log on to the enterprise system any time to look at open purchase requisitions that require approval and to approve those requisitions by checking the acceptance box. The computer records these approvals on the purchase requisition data.
Throughout the day, buyers in the purchasing department receive from the enterprise system online approved requisitions with a list of appropriate suppliers. They select a supplier and enter Purchase Order (PO) data. After the PO is saved, the purchase requisition data and inventory master data are updated. The completed, prenumbered PO is then printed in the purchasing department and mailed to the supplier.
The receiving department inspects and counts the goods when they are received, compares the count to the packing slip, pulls up the PO in the enterprise system, and enters the quantity received. The PO and inventory master data are updated after the receiving record is saved. The general ledger master data are also updated to reflect the increase in the inventory balance
Notes: *A reorder point (ROP) is a specific level at which your stock needs to be replenished. In other words, it tells you when to place an order, so the company will not run out of stock.
